# Cheque OCR System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Extract structured data from cheque images with high accuracy using PaddleOCR technology
• Automate the conversion of unstructured cheque information into structured CSV format
• Reduce manual data entry time and errors in cheque processing workflows
• Support batch processing of multiple cheque images for operational efficiency
• Provide reliable field extraction for: payee name, amount, date, and cheque number

### Background Context

Financial institutions and businesses regularly process large volumes of cheques that require manual data entry into their systems. This manual process is time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. Current OCR solutions often lack the specialized field extraction logic needed for cheque processing, requiring significant post-processing work.

The cheque OCR system addresses this gap by leveraging PaddleOCR's PP-OCRv5 model combined with intelligent field extraction algorithms specifically designed for cheque layouts. This solution will enable automated processing of cheque images, extracting key financial data into structured formats that can be directly imported into accounting and banking systems.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall accept cheque images in common formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF) with minimum resolution of 300 DPI for optimal OCR accuracy.

**FR2:** The system shall extract payee name from cheque images using pattern recognition to identify the "Pay to the order of" field.

**FR3:** The system shall extract numerical and written amount values from cheques, validating consistency between both representations.

**FR4:** The system shall extract date information from cheques in various formats (MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, written dates).

**FR5:** The system shall extract cheque number from the designated cheque number field, typically located in the upper right corner.

**FR6:** The system shall output extracted data in CSV format with columns: cheque_number, payee_name, amount, date, confidence_score, image_filename.

**FR7:** The system shall support batch processing of multiple cheque images from a specified directory.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The system shall process individual cheque images within 10 seconds on standard hardware (4GB RAM, dual-core CPU).

**NFR2:** The system shall achieve minimum 90% accuracy for clearly printed cheques under good lighting conditions.

**NFR3:** The system shall be implemented in Python 3.8+ for cross-platform compatibility.

**NFR4:** The system shall use PaddleOCR PP-OCRv5 as the core OCR engine for text recognition.
